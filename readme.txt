Sabrina Meng & Tay Mitchell Quarter 3 Project

Our database aims to explore UN Sustainable Development Goal #3, specifically child health and nutrition. Our database consists of six tables:

Proportion of overweight children in each region
Number of overweight children in each region
Proportion of wasted (malnourished) children in each region
Number of wated children in each region
GDP growth in each region
Authentication information for users accessing this information

All data were collected over multiple years (2000-2018). Data was not necessarily collected for all regions in all years (due to information and surverying imperfections), and thus, there are many null values in our tables where information was not able to be collected. We mostly chose to analyze the 2015 data because it was the most recent year in which GDP growth data was collected for all countries.

Our database lokos at trends in overweight and wasted children populations across regions and time and also aims to compare rates of overweight and wasted children with GDP growth in the region and world.
